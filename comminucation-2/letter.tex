\opening{Dear Editor,}

We thank again the referees for their careful work. We are happy the referees have responded that we have sufficiently replied on their remarks and the the manuscript is suitable for PRE. 
In response to the additional remark of the first referee we have changed the last sentence of Appendix C. In detail we write  now:

``and this is satisfied \hl{as long as} $D_r > D_c = \gamma \rho_0 / 2$''

instead of 

``and this is satisfied \hl{until} $D_r > D_c = \gamma \rho_0 / 2$''

We also agree with  the objections of the third referee and avoid the notion "hydrodynamic equations" and "hydrodynamics" in the present manuscript. Instead we assign  the equations of the density and for the momentum flux now as the continuum equations of our ensemble of self propelled particles. 
With these changes we resubmit our manuscript for further editorial processing for a publication in the Physical Review E.


\closing{With best regards,\\ Sincerely yours,}

\end{letter}
